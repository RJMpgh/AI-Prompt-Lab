# AI-Prompt-Lab
A collection of AI prompts and their results, documenting the art of prompt engineering.
# üß† AI Prompt Lab
Welcome to the **AI Prompt Lab**! This repository is a collection of AI prompt experiments that showcase how small changes in language can lead to wildly different outputs from AI. Whether you're an AI enthusiast or just curious about the art of prompt engineering, this is a place to explore and get inspired.

## üéØ Project Overview
The AI Prompt Lab explores the power of language when interacting with AI. Here, you'll find examples of prompts across various themes, such as:
- **Jokes**: Simple, funny, and sometimes bizarre jokes generated by AI.
- **Poetry**: Haikus, sonnets, and free verse poetry based on different prompts.
- **Storytelling**: Short stories and creative writing experiments.
- **Advice & Philosophical Questions**: AI‚Äôs take on life‚Äôs big questions.
  
Each experiment includes:
- **The Input Prompt**: The exact text used to generate the response.
- **The AI Response**: What the AI generated based on the prompt.
- **Observations**: Insights on what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and potential ways to improve the prompt.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- **prompts/**: This folder contains the main prompt files, organized by theme.
- **experiment-log/**: Here, you‚Äôll find variations on the original prompts and detailed logs of how AI responses changed with different inputs.
- **README.md**: This file. It contains an overview of the project, the structure, and instructions for contributing or exploring.
